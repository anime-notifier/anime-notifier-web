## AniTrack Web
This project is the web view for anitrack, build on React and generated using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md)

Under the hood, the project uses redux and websocket to read and manipulate data. It also uses react-router that is programmed to follow the folder structure to make it easier to navigate.

There are some enviroment variables that are required to properly run the project. These variables can be seen on [.env.example](https://github.com/anitrack/anitrack-web/blob/master/.env.example). 

The server required to provide data is hosted in a different repo that can be accessed [here](https://github.com/anitrack/anitrack).
